# Getting Started with Git for this Project

This document outlines the best practices we'll follow for version control using Git on this project. By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure a smooth and efficient development workflow while minimizing merge conflicts.

## Branching Strategy:
- We'll primarily use a feature branching strategy. Each developer will work on features or bug fixes in their own branches created from the master branch.
- Feature branch names should be descriptive and start with ```feature/``` followed by a brief description of the feature being implemented (e.g., ```feature/add-user-search```).
- Bug fix branches can be named similarly, starting with bugfix/ (e.g., ```bugfix/login-error```).

## Workflow:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
- Each developer will clone the main project repository to their local machine.

2. **Create a Feature Branch:**
- Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the remote ```development``` branch using the following command:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name> origin/development
```
3. **Develop and Commit:**
- Make your changes, commit them logically using descriptive commit messages, and push them to your remote branch regularly.

4. **Pull Updates:**
- Before pushing your changes, pull the latest updates from the remote ```development``` branch to avoid conflicts:
```bash
git pull origin development
```

5. **Push your Feature Branch:**
- Once you've developed and tested your feature, and resolved any conflicts, push your changes to your remote branch using:
```bash
git push origin feature/<branch_name>
```

6**Merge to Development:**
- Once your feature is complete and tested, create a pull request on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub) to merge your branch back into ```development```.

## Best Practices for Avoiding Version Control Issues:
- **Frequent Pulls:** Regularly pull updates from the remote master branch to stay in sync with other developers' work.
- **Clear Commit Messages:** Write concise and informative commit messages that describe the specific changes made in each commit.
- **Small, Focused Commits:** Make frequent commits that represent logical changes rather than large, complex commits.
- **Resolve Conflicts Promptly:** Address merge conflicts as soon as you encounter them to avoid bigger issues down the line.
- **Code Reviews:** Utilize code reviews before merging branches to ensure code quality and identify potential issues early on.
